In 1752 Britain decided to abandon the Julian calendar in favour of the Gregorian. 
By doing so, 3 September instantly became 14 September.
Because there is a difference of 11 days between both the calanders.
As a result, nothing whatsoever happened in British history between 3 and 13 September 1752.
